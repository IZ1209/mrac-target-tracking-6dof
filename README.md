# Target Tracking and Stabilization using MRAC

This repository presents a physics-based simulation of a 2-DOF gimbal system (Pitch and Yaw) using Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC). It showcases separate MRAC controllers for each axis, realistic actuator and sensor models, and adaptation to external disturbances.

---

## Features

- Full MATLAB simulation using physics-based dynamics
- Separate MRAC control laws for pitch and yaw
- Sensor noise and actuator saturation modeling
- Adaptation gain plots and tracking error analysis
- plots included
